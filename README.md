# ReactJs demo project with usage of other libraries
![REACT](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1468/1*kt9otqHk14BZIMNruiG0BA.png)
# Introduction
I made this back while learning React-router-v4. It's quiet easy as I get along with the flow of Reactjs. ReactJs, React-router-v4 and react-bootstrap all get along to create a single page application with high productivity. 

I now have a clear goal for this project and it was to add more functionality to it and make it easy for beginner to find a demo react project with complete functionality. Also the goal is to keep it simple enough that they can understand it well without the feeling of vomiting (I experience this a lot when taking on JS framework for the first time). 

Feel free to **contribute** to this as this project is intended to help beginner to see how everything work together.

# Future Update
As this project was making for hobbyist, I will add more thing in the futre for demonstration and here is a list:
* Simple API call to other website with using Axios/Superagent
* Websocket realtime example with coincaps.io using socket.io
* Webpack for bundling all the JS-goodness
* MobX for state management (Redux maybe a bit complicated for beginner because of its boilerplate!)
* Add Glamor, css-in-js, for the goodness of `@media query` 

# Installation
The installation is straight forward:
1. git clone https://github.com/GTHell/react-bootsrap-chartJS-layouts.git
2. cd react-bootstrap-chartJS-layouts
3. run `npm install` in terminal
4. run `npm start` in terminal

Open your browser and enter the localhost with the port you specify and you should see the project.
